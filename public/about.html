<p>Hi! I’m a curious and enthusiastic engineering student with a strong interest in building practical, real-world solutions through technology. I’m currently learning full-stack web development and Flutter app development, with a hands-on, project-based approach. Though I’m still early in my journey, I’ve committed myself to learning by doing—focusing not just on theory but on applying concepts in the form of real, functional projects.

So far, I’ve explored HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and have begun diving into frameworks like React as part of Angela Yu’s web development course.</p> <p>I’m also learning Dart and Flutter to build beautiful, responsive mobile apps. I enjoy experimenting with layouts, form designs, and interactive elements that create a smooth user experience. My goal isn’t just to code—but to solve problems creatively.

I’ve started working on projects like academic evaluation systems and plan to expand into more meaningful platforms that can actually be used in college or community settings. Even though I’ve only just begun, I’m constantly pushing myself to take on projects that challenge my understanding and expand my skill set.

Being from an engineering background, I also have experience working with microcontrollers like Arduino and basic electronics projects. This gives me a unique edge in understanding both software and hardware systems, which I aim to integrate more in the future.</p>
<p>I’m not from a coding background, and I didn’t grow up writing programs—but I’m self-driven, willing to ask questions, make mistakes, and keep improving. I believe that consistency beats speed, and every line of code I write brings me one step closer to becoming a better developer.

Beyond just technical skills, I’ve started learning about UI/UX principles, version control (Git & GitHub), and good development practices.</p><p> I’m excited about the idea of building polished, meaningful, and usable digital products—whether it’s a portfolio website, a mobile app, or a collaborative project with others.

This portfolio is a small reflection of where I am now—and a space where I’ll continue to showcase what I build and learn along the way. I’m excited about the future and always open to feedback, collaboration, and new challenges.</p>

Let’s build something awesome together!
